CHANGELOG
=================================================================
* The Aircraft folder has been renamed to EF-Typhoon, to reflect a path different to the original "eurofighter" and different to the FGUK version "EF2000"
* All paths have been fixed to the new folder name
* The Aircraft has been isolated: This is, it contains no dependencies to foreign Aircraft. Previously it had dependencies to the sabre and the mosquito, outcommented in the xml files. The files required had been imported and renamed, in spite of being outcommented in the configuration
* The Filename paths had been changed from typhoon to EF-Typhoon, and all file calls had been fixed recursively
* Hud had been moved to Systems/hud directory
* All RGB textures had been migrated to PNG textures, and filenames had been standardized to English
* Stereo Sound Files had been remasterized to Mono
* Autopilot V5 installed and tested to work on FG 2.12 and FG 3.20. Improved maneuverability and correct Vertical Mode Management
* Fixes on FDM for the Yasim version

NOTES (TRANSLATED FROM THE SPANISH VERSION BY IH-COL: JAN 2015)
=================================================================
We strongly advise to reduce sensitivity of the joystick or mouse to avoid strong maneuvers, until the Automatic Pilot is further developed. It is also rather easy to exceed the structural limits of this aircraft, and perform ultra high-'G' maneuvers without a consequence: as a last resort we remmit to the skills of each pilot to keep the aircraft within admissible limitations. Currently, the aircraft is very maneuverable and flexible, once the difficulty posed by the controls overresponse is overcome. Nonetheless, since there is a lack of features on the automatic pilot, it is still feasible to loss control, and enter on spinning after strong handling, or due to the primitive state of such functions in the current status of the Automatic Pilot.  It is advised to reduce thrust to a minimum, extend speedbrake to maximum (landing gear and slats deployment won't hurt), and position stick in neutral; this to increase the likelihood of stopping spinning and of easing recovery of the aircraft's control.

HOWTO land in an aircraft carrier (without extra loads):
Ideally on an approach at 130 KIAS and AoA -5, and touching the plattform at an AoA near +5, while attempting to keep a vertical speed (Vsp) not superior to -2500, to avoid bouncing over the plattform (the instrument to read vertical speed has a certain delay, thus this is an orientation value).
It is possible to arrest the hook to a higher speed, causing the bow to dig on the plattform, but currently this phenomena has no major consequences (except this happens with an excess and the aircraft ends floating on the water).

The current speedbrake has 5 positions: 4 and 5 will brake below 130 KIAS. Speedbrake has a very accused secondary effect on the Angle of Attack. A trick consists in making the most of this reaction of prancing to softly land the plattform with a positive AoA (approx. +5)

HOWTO land in an aircraft carrier (with extra loads):
In case of carrying load the maneuvering margins are reduce, and it is necessary to keep higher speeds to conserve the lift.
